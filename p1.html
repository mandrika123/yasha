          Homelessness or houselessness – also known as a state of being
          unhoused or unsheltered – is the condition of lacking stable, safe,
          and adequate housing. The definition of homelessness differs from
          country to country, with some countries yet to have any definition in
          place. People can be categorized as homeless if they are: living on
          the streets (primary homelessness); moving between temporary shelters,
          including houses of friends, family, and emergency accommodation
          (secondary homelessness); and living in private boarding houses
          without a private bathroom or security of tenure (tertiary
          homelessness).[1] have no permanent house or place to live safely
          Internally Displaced Persons, persons compelled to leave their places
          of domicile.
